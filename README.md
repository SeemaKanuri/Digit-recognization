# Digit-recognization

1.	I tried of using the convolutional neural network , CNN in Python but end up struggling a long time installing few packages and I spend vertually a long time on setting the framework for the required packages.

2.	However R seems to be an easy choice where I was able to do the analysis in a quick time. To train the 	data I have used 2 hidden layers NN model with each of 3000 nodes and an epoch of 1000 using the h2o package on a subset lof data which lasted for longer than 40 minutes.

3.	Apart from 2 hidden layer NN using the h2o package, I also tried xgboost and random forest models. However the best accuracy I got is with H2O 2 hidden layer NN with accuracy score of 0.97800


4. This folder contains 3 sufolder of three different  Models .
	Model-1  Neural Networks ( best accuracy model) score 0.98129 
	Model-2 xgboost score 0.97123
	Model-3 random forest 0.95369

5. Each subfolder has , R code , Output predicted value file , and Rmarkdown file for p
